## Virtual Zookeeper 🐫🦁🐒

A Java program to simulate a virtual zoo with different animal habitats in ASCII Code that can be viewed through a simple command-line interface. 

### Project Overview 🐾

This project was developed as part of the Java Developer track on HyperSkill. The program uses Java's text blocks and try/catch statements to display various animal habitats, and the user can select which habitat to view by entering a corresponding number.

### Usage 🦁

To run the program, simply compile and run the `Main.java` file:
The user will then be prompted to enter the number of the habitat they wish to view.

### What I Learned 🐵

Through this project, I learned how to use text blocks to display multi-line strings in a more readable way, as well as how to implement try/catch statements to handle exceptions and improve the program's error handling. This was done to refresh my Java Skills, the learning track helped with my understand in control flow, ternary operators and more advanced java syntax. 

Additionally, I gained experience with Git and GitHub, including creating a new repository, adding and committing files, and pushing changes to a remote repository.

### Conclusion 🐼

Overall, this was a fun and educational project that allowed me to practice various Java programming concepts and improve my skills as a developer. I'm excited to continue learning and working on similar projects in the future.
